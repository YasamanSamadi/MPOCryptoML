All experiments are conducted on an AWS EC2 g4dn.2xlarge instance, featuring an NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPU, 32 GiB of memory, and 225 GB of NVMe SSD local storage, running Linux. The proposed model is developed in Python. For all experiments, parameters are set as follows: α = 0.5, pf = 1, and ρ = 1 [50]. Key tuning parameters, including Maximum Iterations (maxiter = 1000) and the Solver set to liblinear, are crucial for optimizing performance.
